# whoops-fake-aws-keys
This is where some ting tangs put fake keys to make sure their tests worked.

You know, keys like the ones that are copied from the [IAM guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html). What are the odds some Monero mining bot tries to use these to spin up an EC2 instance? Pretty good, IMO.

Oh, right - the keys themselves are:
* Access Key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
* Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
